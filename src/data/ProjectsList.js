         JaKi is an Android based application that functions as the user's traffic safety assistant. 
         It is a platform for people to get the information of the dangerous traffic and report violations. 
         The app mainly has 3 features: Auto-routing navigation, Report troublespot in vicinity, Education feature as 
         Articles, Infographics, Videos, and Podcasts.
         All the app interfaces and logo are designed by my team.

         Moneige (pronounced /'maaÂ·nihj/) is an Android based application for personal financial management. 
         I believe other applications are too complex, therefore I created one that is straightforward using only one 
         button and one screen. All the app interfaces and logo are designed by me using Adobe XD.
